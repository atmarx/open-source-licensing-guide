## Defining "NonCommercial"

The NC restriction is the most debated aspect of Creative Commons licensing. The license defines noncommercial as:

> not primarily intended for or directed towards commercial advantage or monetary compensation

### What's clearly non-commercial:

- Personal blogs without ads
- Classroom use by teachers
- Research without commercial funding
- Non-profit organization use

### What's clearly commercial:

- Selling the work
- Using in advertising
- Including in for-profit products
- Commercial website content

### The gray areas:

| Use Case | Commercial? |
|----------|-------------|
| Blog with ads | Debated—depends on primary purpose |
| University use | Usually non-commercial, but varies |
| Corporate training | Often commercial |
| Non-profit selling merchandise | Debated |
| Sponsored YouTube video | Likely commercial |

!!! warning "NC creates uncertainty"
    The gray areas around NonCommercial create hesitation for many potential users. If broad adoption matters, consider whether NC serves your goals.

## Why NC Is Controversial

### The case for NC:

- Protects creators from exploitation
- Reserves commercial rights for licensing deals
- Allows free sharing without "giving away" everything
- Popular with photographers, artists, musicians

### The case against NC:

- "NonCommercial" is poorly defined
- Creates legal uncertainty for users
- Excludes Free Culture/Open Source communities
- May reduce adoption and impact
- Many educational contexts are ambiguous

## Dual Licensing with NC

Many creators use NC strategically:

1. Release under CC BY-NC for free sharing
2. Offer commercial licenses separately for paying customers

This is similar to software dual licensing (e.g., GPL + commercial license).

## NC and Other Restrictions

NC can combine with other elements:

| License | Commercial | Derivatives | ShareAlike |
|---------|-----------|-------------|------------|
| CC BY-NC | No | Yes | No |
| CC BY-NC-SA | No | Yes | Yes |
| CC BY-NC-ND | No | No | — |

CC BY-NC-ND is the most restrictive standard license (short of "all rights reserved").

## When to Choose CC BY-NC

CC BY-NC may be appropriate when:

- You want to reserve commercial rights
- Your audience is primarily non-commercial (educators, individuals)
- You're testing the waters before going more open
- Commercial licensing is part of your business model

## When to Choose Something Else

- Want maximum adoption → CC BY or CC0
- Want derivatives to stay open → CC BY-SA (with commercial allowed)
- Want to prevent modifications → CC BY-ND or CC BY-NC-ND
- For software → Don't use CC at all

## The Free Culture Perspective

Creative Commons, FSF, and Wikipedia consider NC licenses "non-free" because they restrict who can use the work. Wikipedia and Wikimedia Commons don't accept NC-licensed content.

If you want your work to be part of the broader open knowledge commons, avoid NC.

## Notable Uses of CC BY-NC

- Many individual photographers and artists
- Some educational materials
- Personal music releases
- Various YouTube creators (though this limits reuse)
