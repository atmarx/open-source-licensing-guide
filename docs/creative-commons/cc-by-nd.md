# CC BY-ND (Attribution-NoDerivatives)

CC BY-ND allows sharing but prohibits derivatives. The work must be passed along unchanged. This is used when creators want wide distribution but integrity of the original.

## "No Derivatives" Explained

Under CC BY-ND, you can only share the work in its original form. You may not:

- Edit or crop images
- Remix music
- Translate text
- Adapt to different contexts
- Create derivative works of any kind

### Format Shifting Is Allowed

You may change the format (e.g., convert a PDF to EPUB) as long as the content remains unchanged. You must indicate that you made a format change.

### Private Modifications

The license only restricts *sharing* derivatives. You may:

- Mark up a document for personal use
- Crop an image for your desktop wallpaper
- Edit for private study

Just don't share your modifications.

## Why Choose ND?

### Integrity and Accuracy

Some works need to remain unchanged:

- Official statements or policies
- Scientific papers (accuracy matters)
- Artistic works (creative vision)
- Manifestos or position papers

Allowing modifications could lead to misrepresentation.

### Quality Control

Creators may not trust random modifications to maintain quality. Rather than risk poor derivatives circulating, they prevent derivatives entirely.

### Personal Preference

Some creators simply don't want their work altered. Photography and visual art communities often prefer ND.

## The Critique of ND

### Prevents Beneficial Uses

ND prevents:

- Translations (limiting international reach)
- Accessibility adaptations
- Educational adaptations for context
- Building upon ideas

### Not "Open"

Like NC, ND is not considered "Free Culture" because it restricts a fundamental freedom—the right to modify and build upon.

Wikipedia and Wikimedia Commons don't accept ND content because it can't be improved or adapted.

### Incompatible with Collaboration

Open source and open culture depend on the ability to modify. ND works exist in isolation—they can't be incorporated into collaborative projects.

## CC BY-NC-ND

The most restrictive standard CC license combines NoDerivatives with NonCommercial:

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **SPDX Identifier** | `CC-BY-NC-ND-4.0` |
| **Free Culture** | No |

This allows only non-commercial, verbatim sharing. Common uses:

- Personal photography portfolios
- Independent music releases
- Conference talks and presentations
- Pre-print academic papers

CC BY-NC-ND essentially says: "Look, but don't touch (commercially or derivatively)."

## When to Choose CC BY-ND

CC BY-ND may be appropriate when:

- Accuracy and integrity are paramount
- You don't want the work taken out of context
- You want wide distribution but no modifications
- It's a complete work not intended for adaptation

## When to Choose Something Else

- Want your work to be translated → Any license without ND
- Want to build a commons → CC BY or CC BY-SA
- Want others to build on your work → Avoid ND
- For software → Never use CC

## Practical Considerations

If you're torn on ND:

- Consider whether *any* derivative could be good
- Translations alone often justify avoiding ND
- Accessibility adaptations are prevented by ND
- You can always grant permission case-by-case

Some creators choose CC BY (allowing derivatives) while maintaining moral rights—the right to object to derogatory treatment of their work.

## Notable Uses

- Some academic pre-prints (before peer review)
- Personal photography collections
- Music by artists who want exposure but not remixing
- Official organizational materials
