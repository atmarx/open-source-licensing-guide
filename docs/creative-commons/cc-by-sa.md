# CC BY-SA (Attribution-ShareAlike)

CC BY-SA is the copyleft Creative Commons license. Like CC BY, it allows free use with attribution. The addition of ShareAlike requires that derivatives use the same (or compatible) license.

## ShareAlike Explained

The ShareAlike clause means:

```
CC BY-SA Work ──► Your Adaptation ──► Must be CC BY-SA (or compatible)
```

If you create a derivative work, you must license your contributions under the same terms. This is "copyleft" for creative works—ensuring that openness propagates.

### What counts as a derivative?

| Action | Derivative? | ShareAlike applies? |
|--------|-------------|-------------------|
| Verbatim copying | No | Just follow CC BY-SA |
| Translation | Yes | Must be CC BY-SA |
| Adapting for new context | Yes | Must be CC BY-SA |
| Collecting in anthology | Usually no | Original stays CC BY-SA, your additions can differ |
| Remixing or mashup | Yes | Must be CC BY-SA |

### Collections vs Derivatives

A collection (anthology, compilation) where works remain separate doesn't trigger ShareAlike. The individual works keep their licenses, and your selection/arrangement can be separately licensed.

But if you integrate the work into something new (derivative), ShareAlike applies to the whole.

## Compatible Licenses

CC BY-SA 4.0 can be one-way compatible with other copyleft licenses. Creative Commons maintains a list of compatible licenses—currently including:

- CC BY-SA 4.0 International
- Free Art License 1.3
- GPL v3 (for appropriate content)

This means you could incorporate CC BY-SA work into a GPL v3 project, but the result would be GPL v3 (not CC BY-SA).

## CC BY-SA vs GPL

Both are copyleft, but for different domains:

| Aspect | CC BY-SA | GPL |
|--------|----------|-----|
| Designed for | Creative works | Software |
| Source code | Not a concept | Required |
| Patent provisions | None | Yes (v3) |
| Modification disclosure | "Indicate changes" | Mark modified files |
| Compatibility | GPL v3 (one-way) | Not with CC BY-SA |

## Private Use Exception

ShareAlike only applies when you **share** your adaptation. You can:

- Create private adaptations
- Modify for personal use
- Use internally in an organization

Without sharing publicly, no ShareAlike obligations kick in.

## CC BY-NC-SA

Adding NonCommercial to ShareAlike creates CC BY-NC-SA:

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **SPDX Identifier** | `CC-BY-NC-SA-4.0` |
| **Free Culture** | No (NC restriction) |

This is popular for educational content where creators want:

- Open sharing among educators
- Adaptations to remain open
- Commercial publishers to need separate licenses

## When to Choose CC BY-SA

CC BY-SA is appropriate when:

- You want derivatives to stay open
- You believe in "share alike" philosophy
- Commercial use is fine if sharing continues
- You're building a commons (like Wikipedia)

## When to Choose Something Else

- Don't care if derivatives close → CC BY
- Want to block commercial use → CC BY-NC-SA
- Want maximum freedom → CC0
- For software → Use GPL, not CC BY-SA

## Notable Works Under CC BY-SA

- Wikipedia (all content)
- OpenStreetMap data (until 2012, then ODbL)
- Stack Overflow content (answers and questions)
- Many textbooks and OER (Open Educational Resources)
