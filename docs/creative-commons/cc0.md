# CC0 (Public Domain Dedication)

CC0 is not a license—it's a waiver. It places work in the public domain by waiving all copyright and related rights to the maximum extent possible. No attribution required, no restrictions of any kind.

## At a Glance

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **SPDX Identifier** | `CC0-1.0` |
| **Type** | Public domain dedication |
| **Free Culture** | Yes |
| **Attribution Required** | No |
| **Any Restrictions** | No |

## What It Allows

- :material-check: Everything
- :material-check: Commercial use
- :material-check: Modification
- :material-check: Distribution
- :material-check: Private use
- :material-check: No attribution required
- :material-check: Use without any conditions

## What It Requires

- Nothing

## What It Prohibits

- Nothing (as far as copyright goes)

## How CC0 Works

CC0 operates in three layers:

### 1. Public Domain Dedication

First, it attempts to waive all copyright:

> To the greatest extent permitted by... law, [the person] hereby... dedicates the Work to the public domain

### 2. Fallback License

If waiver isn't legally possible (some jurisdictions don't allow it):

> [The person] grants... a royalty-free, non-exclusive, irrevocable... license to use the Work

This is essentially an unlimited permissive license as fallback.

### 3. Moral Rights Waiver

Where possible, it waives "moral rights"—rights to attribution and integrity that exist in some legal systems.

## CC0 vs Other Public Domain Tools

| Tool | Legal Framework | Best For |
|------|----------------|----------|
| CC0 | Thorough international coverage | Data, research, creative works |
| Unlicense | Simple dedication | Software, quick releases |
| 0BSD | BSD license structure | Organizations wanting license form |

CC0 is the most legally thorough option, drafted with international law in mind.

## Why Choose "No Rights"?

### Maximum Impact

CC0 removes all friction. Anyone can use the work for anything without:

- Tracking attribution requirements
- Worrying about license compatibility
- Legal review for commercial use
- Any hesitation at all

### Data and Databases

For data, CC0 is often ideal because:

- Facts themselves aren't copyrightable (in most jurisdictions)
- Database rights (where they exist) are waived
- Scientific norms provide attribution through citation
- Machine processing doesn't preserve attribution anyway

### Building a Commons

CC0 contributes to a shared public domain. Works truly belong to everyone.

## Attribution Norms vs Requirements

CC0 doesn't require attribution, but:

- Academic citation norms still apply
- It's polite to credit sources
- It's honest to acknowledge others' work
- Many fields expect citation regardless of legal requirements

The difference: someone who doesn't cite you isn't breaking the law—just norms.

## When to Choose CC0

CC0 is appropriate when:

- You want maximum possible reuse
- Attribution isn't important to you
- You're releasing data or databases
- You want to contribute to the public domain
- License compatibility must never be an issue

## When to Choose Something Else

- You want credit → CC BY
- You want derivatives to stay open → CC BY-SA
- You're releasing software → Unlicense, MIT, or other software license
- You need to reserve commercial rights → CC BY-NC

## CC0 for Research Data

CC0 is the recommendation of many funders and institutions for research data:

- **Science Commons Protocol for Open Data:** Recommends CC0
- **DataCite:** Compatible with CC0
- **FAIR Data Principles:** CC0 supports FAIRness

Citation practices provide attribution in academic contexts. The legal simplicity of CC0 enables data sharing.

## Risks and Considerations

### You can't take it back

Once you dedicate something to the public domain, it's gone. Anyone can do anything with it. Consider carefully.

### Patent and trademark

CC0 waives copyright, not patents or trademarks. If your work involves patented methods or trademarked names, those remain protected.

### Moral rights in some jurisdictions

Some countries don't allow waiving moral rights. In those cases, the fallback license applies, but moral rights may persist.
