## Key Points

### Maximum Simplicity

MIT imposes only one real obligation: include the copyright notice and license text when you redistribute the code. That's it. There's no requirement to share source code, no patent considerations, no compatibility headaches.

### No Patent Grant

Unlike Apache 2.0, MIT says nothing about patents. If a contributor holds a patent covering the code, you receive no explicit license to that patent. For most projects this is theoretical, but it's a consideration for enterprise adoption.

### Compatible With Everything

MIT-licensed code can be:

- Included in proprietary software
- Relicensed under different terms
- Combined with code under virtually any other license

This makes MIT code extremely easy to incorporate into other projects.

## When to Use MIT

MIT is a good choice when:

- You want maximum adoption
- You don't care if others use your code in proprietary products
- Simplicity is a priority
- You're building libraries, utilities, or tools

## When to Consider Alternatives

- If you want improvements to come back to the community → consider copyleft
- If patent protection matters → consider Apache 2.0
- If you want no attribution requirement → consider Unlicense or CC0

## Notable Projects Using MIT
