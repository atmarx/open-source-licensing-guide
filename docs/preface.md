# Preface

I was born in 1983—the same year Richard Stallman announced the GNU Project. My dad brought home an IBM 8086 when I was five, and I've been fixing, using, and explaining computers ever since.

I grew up in the middle of it. I was there when my dad upgraded us to a 386DX-33 and finally retired the dot matrix printer that had buzzed through my childhood. I read *Where Wizards Stay Up Late* and wanted to start my own ISP. I was helping neighbors with their computers at twelve. I was my high school's webmaster while the browser wars raged (*"it works fine in Netscape Navigator, but why does IE4 look so weird?"*).

But I was young. I watched the foundational battles from the headlines—seeing the names and players connected to software I used, but lacking the political understanding to connect the bigger picture. I knew the names—Stallman, Torvalds, Raymond—but I knew them the way a kid knows the adults are arguing about something important without quite grasping what.

## Why This Guide Exists

I work with researchers and developers who are even further removed from this history than I am. To them, "open source" is just how software works now. They've never had to think about why MIT and GPL are different, or what it means when a company relicenses their project. They assume someone else has figured this out.

Someone has. But that knowledge lives in mailing list archives, conference talks, and the memories of people who were there. It's not written down in one place, in plain language, for people who just need to understand enough to make good decisions.

This guide is my attempt to fix that.

## About the Voice

You'll notice this guide is written from the perspective of a grizzled veteran—someone who watched the free software movement unfold from the beginning, who sat through the flame wars and lived through the license battles.

That's not me. That voice is a deliberate choice.

I wanted this guide to feel like getting advice from someone who'd seen it all. Not a legal textbook, not a Wikipedia article, but the kind of practical wisdom you'd get from a mentor who's been around long enough to know where the bodies are buried. The voice is a composite—part oral history, part the tone I wish someone had used when explaining this stuff to me.

The events are real. The lessons are real. The "I was there" framing is a narrative device. Consider it historical fiction in service of education.

## How This Was Made

I built this guide with Claude, Anthropic's AI assistant. Claude helped me research, organize, write, and maintain something resembling academic rigor.

The collaboration worked like this: I knew what I wanted to say and roughly how I wanted to say it. Claude helped me say it clearly, consistently, and with proper citations. Every claim is sourced, and every opinion is marked as opinion. The errors that remain are mine.

Using AI to write about open source licensing feels appropriate, somehow. The tools we use shape how we work. Acknowledging them is part of the transparency this community values.

Why NonCommercial? Because I built this to help people, not to create a product. The NC clause keeps it that way while still allowing the sharing and adaptation that makes open resources valuable.

Now, let's talk about licensing.
