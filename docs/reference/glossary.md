# Glossary

Key terms used throughout this guide. Terms marked with * appear as tooltips on highlighted text throughout the site.

---

## A

### Attribution*
Credit given to the original creator as required by a license. Almost every open source license requires attribution when redistributing code.

### AGPL (Affero General Public License)
A strong copyleft license that extends GPL to cover network use. If you run modified AGPL software as a web service, you must provide source code to users.

---

## B

### Binary*
Compiled, machine-readable form of software, as opposed to source code. Many licenses have different requirements for source vs binary distribution.

### BSD License
A family of permissive licenses from UC Berkeley. The 2-clause and 3-clause versions are most common today.

---

## C

### Contributor*
Someone who adds code or content to a project. Contributors may grant licenses to their contributions.

### Contributor License Agreement (CLA)
A legal agreement where contributors grant additional rights to a project. Often used to enable dual licensing or relicensing.

### Copyleft*
A licensing approach requiring derivative works to use the same license. Ensures that modifications remain open source.

### Copyright
Legal right automatically granted to creators of original works. In most jurisdictions, this is automatic upon creation.

---

## D

### Derivative Work*
A new work based on or derived from an existing copyrighted work. Whether something is a derivative work is often the key question for copyleft licenses.

### Disclaimer*
Statement limiting liability, typically required to be preserved when redistributing software.

### Distribution*
The act of sharing or providing software to others. Most license obligations are triggered by distribution.

### Downstream*
Projects or users that build upon or use an upstream project. In open source, changes flow from upstream to downstream.

### Dual Licensing*
Offering software under two different licenses simultaneously. Common for commercial open source: GPL for community, paid license for proprietary use.

---

## F

### FLOSS*
Free/Libre and Open Source Software. Emphasizes the freedom aspect of "free."

### FOSS*
Free and Open Source Software. General term for software with open source licenses.

### Free Culture
Works licensed to allow sharing, modification, and commercial use. CC BY, CC BY-SA, and CC0 are Free Culture licenses; NC and ND variants are not.

### Free Software
Software that respects users' freedom. Defined by the FSF as having four freedoms: to run, study, redistribute, and modify.

### FSF*
Free Software Foundation. Organization that advocates for free software and maintains the GPL.

---

## G

### GPL (General Public License)
The most important copyleft license, created by the FSF. Requires derivative works to be GPL-licensed when distributed.

### Gratis*
Free as in cost—referring to price, not rights. Software can be gratis without being libre.

---

## L

### LGPL (Lesser General Public License)
A weak copyleft license for libraries. Allows proprietary software to link against LGPL libraries while requiring library modifications to be shared.

### Libre*
Free as in freedom—referring to rights and permissions, not price. The "free" in "free software."

### License Compatibility*
Whether code under different licenses can be legally combined. Not all open source licenses are compatible with each other.

---

## M

### MIT License
The most popular permissive open source license. Extremely short and simple, requiring only attribution.

### Moral Rights
Rights to attribution and integrity that exist in some legal systems. Some cannot be waived even with permissive licenses.

### MPL (Mozilla Public License)
A weak copyleft license operating at the file level. Modified files must be MPL; new files can use any license.

---

## N

### NonCommercial*
License restriction prohibiting use for commercial purposes. Used in CC BY-NC and related licenses.

### NoDerivatives*
License restriction prohibiting creation of derivative works. Used in CC BY-ND and related licenses.

### Notice*
Required text that must be included when redistributing licensed software. Usually includes copyright notice and license reference.

---

## O

### Open Source
Software with a license approved by the OSI meeting the Open Source Definition. Source code is available and users have specific guaranteed rights.

### Open Source Definition
Criteria established by the OSI for what makes a license "open source." Includes free redistribution, source availability, and no discrimination.

### OSI*
Open Source Initiative. Organization that reviews and approves licenses as "open source."

### OSI-Approved*

## P

### Patent Grant*
License provision giving users rights to any patents held by contributors. Included in Apache 2.0, GPL v3, and MPL 2.0.

### Permissive License*

### Proprietary*
Software with restricted rights, typically closed-source and commercially licensed.

### Public Domain*
Works not protected by copyright, free for any use without restriction. In some jurisdictions, creators cannot directly dedicate to public domain.

---

## S

### Share-Alike*
License term requiring derivatives to use the same or compatible license. The "SA" in CC BY-SA.

### ShareAlike
See Share-Alike.

### Source Available
Software whose source code is visible but which has restrictions incompatible with open source. SSPL and BSL are source available, not open source.

### Source Code*
Human-readable form of software, as opposed to compiled binary code. Many licenses require source availability.

### SPDX*
Software Package Data Exchange. Standard format for communicating license information. Provides standardized identifiers like `MIT` or `Apache-2.0`.

### Strong Copyleft*
Copyleft that applies to the entire combined work, not just modified files. GPL is strong copyleft.

### Sublicense*
The right to grant license rights to others. Permissive licenses generally allow sublicensing.

---

## T

### Tivoization*
Using hardware restrictions to prevent users from running modified software, even when the source code is available. Named after TiVo devices that ran GPL-licensed Linux but used cryptographic signatures to block user modifications. GPL v3 specifically prohibits this practice.

---

## U

### Upstream*
The original project from which a fork or derivative is created. Changes often flow from upstream to downstream projects.

---

## V

### Viral License*
Informal term for copyleft licenses that "spread" to derivative works. Generally considered pejorative.

---

## W

### Weak Copyleft*
Copyleft that only applies to modifications of the original files, not the larger work. LGPL and MPL are weak copyleft.
